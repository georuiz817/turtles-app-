## Turles-App 

Turtles-App is simple yet fun pizza maker. Users will have the ability to create a piece of pizza based off the four pizza properties. Once they’ve chosen the Ninja Turtle of their choice, they will be able to view their pizza along with everyone else’s on the pizza board. To showcase my skills in JavaScript more I also added a delete function. It was pretty tough adding that in at the last min per the technical reviewers request. However, researching and looking to another colleague for some advice I was able to get it done. It was a great learning expierence in regards to figuring out how to request help while making sure you're the one actually doing the work and figuring the problem out.

## Completed Requirements  

• The application must be an HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frontend with a Rails API backend. All interactions between the client and the server must be handled asynchronously (AJAX) and use JSON as the communication format.  

• The JavaScript application must use Object Oriented JavaScript (classes) to encapsulate related data and behavior.

• The domain model served by the Rails backend must include a resource with at least one has-many relationship. For example, if you were building an Instagram clone, you might display a list of photos with associated comments.  

• The backend and frontend must collaborate to demonstrate Client-Server Communication. Your application should have at least 3 AJAX calls, covering at least 2 of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). Your client-side JavaScript code must use fetch with the appropriate HTTP verb, and your Rails API should use RESTful conventions.
